This cluster is an exploration of intersections, vagaries, tensions and overlaps of everyday life and play broadly conceived. What is the relation between play and the everyday? Are they contained within each other? Do they overlap or are they impossible to reconcile? Does play exist with the everyday or does it interrupt or displace it? By looking at a broad range of both "everydays" and "plays" we can start to understand what is at stake in taking both seriously.
