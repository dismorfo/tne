On June 14 and 15, 2011, six upper division undergraduate students from the University of South Carolina went out into the streets of Columbia \[SC\]. Their assignment: to observe how surveillance happens in and around them everyday. Their findings are presented here. Informed by readings in theory, visual-material culture, and constitutional law, as well as fiction, films, and online news articles, the students offer a timely commentary on the routine--and often unacknowledged--practices of surveillance.
