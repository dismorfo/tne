"THE OPERATIVE IMAGE" is a collection of articles exploring the new function of the image, which, as Harun Farocki has put it, no longer represents an object but is part of an operation. In so doing, the cluster hopes to shed new light on the digital imageâ€™s entanglement in diverse fields of operation, such as cybercrime, computer vision, and medical imaging.
