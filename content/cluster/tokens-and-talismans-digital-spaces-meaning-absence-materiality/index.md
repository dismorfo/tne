Materiality is shifting to the digital. We make photographs with our digital devices, share them in social media spaces, and store them on hard drives. Photo albums, souvenirs, and talismans connect us to the past, and their materiality can be a link to another person. Can virtual objects provide this sense of connection? How do these transitions from material to digital transform the things we carry with us? If experience is ephemeral, do objects matter?
