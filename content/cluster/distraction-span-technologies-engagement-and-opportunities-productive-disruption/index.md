[**Alex Juhasz**](http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/~ajuhasz/) and I initiate a conversation about social media that sidesteps the panic over youth and digital distraction, and instead looks head-on at their everyday engagements with mobile devices and social networking. Our aim is to challenge pathologizing discourses that frame young users of social media as simultaneously victims and threat.
